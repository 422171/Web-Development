# Web-Development
This repository holds the web development projects inspired by freeCodeCamp tutorials.

**FOLDER HTML:**
The tutorial folder contains my version of main, about, index html files. These were written while learning from freeCodeCamp's youtube tutorial on HTML by Dave Gray.

The project folder consists of home, hours, contact html files (The actual work) and css file index that is provided by freeCodeCamp in the tutorial. 

**FOLDER PROJECTS:**
This section contains two projects "anime survey form" and "Tribute page on Albus Dumbledore" created as part of the "Responsive Web Design" curriculum by freeCodeCamp




P.S.: Many thanks to se√±or Dave Gray. His Tutorials were awesome.
Adios!
