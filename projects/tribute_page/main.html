        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was born in the summer of 1881 to Percival and Kendra Dumbledore in the quaint village of Mould-on-the-Wold. From a young age, Albus exhibited extraordinary magical abilities, marking him as a prodigious talent destined for greatness. His early life, however, was not without hardship.</p>
        <p>Tragedy struck the Dumbledore family when Albus's younger sister, Ariana, suffered a traumatic magical incident at the hands of Muggle boys. This event led to his father's imprisonment and the family's subsequent move to Godric's Hollow. In the aftermath, Albus assumed the role of caretaker for his siblings, Aberforth and Ariana, after their mother’s untimely death.

</p>
        <p>Despite these personal challenges, Dumbledore's brilliance shone through. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was sorted into Gryffindor House. His time at Hogwarts was marked by academic excellence and a burgeoning reputation as one of the most gifted wizards of his age.</p>
        <p>During a transformative summer, Dumbledore met Gellert Grindelwald, a young and exceptionally talented wizard visiting his great-aunt Bathilda Bagshot in Godric's Hollow. Their meeting was serendipitous and profound, sparking an intense intellectual and emotional connection. Both wizards shared grand visions of magical dominance and a new world order, driven by their belief in the greater good. They dreamed of uniting the Deathly Hallows to become Masters of Death and bring about a revolution in the wizarding world.</p>
        <p>However, their friendship was not without its darker side. Grindelwald’s charisma and radical ideas influenced Dumbledore, leading him to entertain dangerous thoughts about power and control. This period of Dumbledore’s life was marked by a moral ambiguity that he would later deeply regret. The turning point came when a heated argument between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald resulted in a tragic three-way duel. Ariana was accidentally killed in the crossfire, leaving Dumbledore devastated and ending his friendship with Grindelwald.</p>
        <p>The loss of Ariana and the realization of the consequences of his ambitions profoundly affected Dumbledore. He abandoned his previous ideals and dedicated himself to a life of wisdom, responsibility, and the pursuit of knowledge for the greater good. This pivotal relationship with Grindelwald and its tragic end played a crucial role in shaping Dumbledore into the wise and compassionate leader he would become.</p>

          <h2>A drop of his wisdom:</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>"Of course it’s happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean that it’s not real?"</li>
          <li>“It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices.”</li>
          <li>“Curiosity is not a sin, Harry. However, from time to time, you should exercise caution.”</li>
          <li>“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and above all, those who live without love.”</li>
          <li>“You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”</li>
          <li>“Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.</li>
          <li>“For in dreams, we enter a world that is entirely our own. Let him swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.”</li>

          <h2 class="cursive">Why he is an All-Time Favourite of mine </h2>
          <p class="cursive">
            Professor Dumbledore was not just a headmaster of a magic school in London to me, he is character that shaped my thoughts, lifestyle, and much more. He is the man I go to when in despair, or in peace, too. He is the greatest wizard that I rever from the depths my heart. And of course, he is the finest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. The initial display of his kindness, followed by his potential and authority, the revelation of what mastermind he was and every other part where even his name pops up are all my favourite parts in the story. One can assume that the only thing that stops me from becoming a full-time "Harry Potter story-teller" is him telling <i>"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."</i>

            <span class="sub-head" >One Final note:</span> If you are already a part of HP fandom, I am terribly sorry for anything in here that disappointed you. I had to make this web page as a part of learning web development and I had to focus more on the "learning" part than the "writing(the blog)" part. Hope you don't take it to the heart, wise wizard(or witch, what ever you prefer)! 
            <br>And if you are new to Harry Potter stuff and are feeling like all that's written above is gibberish, don't worry, you're not wrong! It's the way I wrote. But trust me, Harry Potter series is one of the top-rated, and lfe-changing books. I highly recommend you to NOT watch the movies and go for the books, even if you feel like you can't read long novels, let alone series. Because, as someone famously said and I quote <strong>"The book is a film that takes place in the mind of the reader"</strong>, and hence the movie is just the director's version of the book. And if you're still in doubt reading books, JUST TRY IT!<i> Every one</i> can read books. Reading is not a process you learn, but the art you are born with, just like the blood in your veins.
